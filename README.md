# LESS-IS-MORE

***Less is More*** is an online community that connects people around the world to give and receive donations. We create safe and comfortable space for community members to help each other and share stories. Through this site, we want to (1) motivate people to donate belongings that they don't need to people who need them; (2) help people to find donations that are useful to them.

**Our Target Users**
1. People who want to give donations and also know where their donation goes. 
2. People who need donations which match their needs. 

**Main problems** 
1. People want to donate things they don't use but they are afraid that their donations don't get to the hands of people who need them. 

2. People who look for donations but struggle to find the ones they actually need.

**Objectives/features**
1. Users can log in with google accounts.
2. Users can upload information and share stories about the items they want to donate.(When they create a new post, the new post will show up in the “newest posts” list on the homepage.)
3. Users can create post that describes the kind of donation they would like to receive from others and why.
4. Users can see posts about donation or request for donations from others. 
5. Users can get suggestions from the platform about donations or request for donations that match their needs. (We can't realize the 'matching needs' feature right now, but will be able to in the future.)
6. Users can delete their own posts.
